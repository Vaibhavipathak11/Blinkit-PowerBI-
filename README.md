# BlinkIT_Dashboard
📌 Problem Statement
Blinkit generates large volumes of sales data across multiple outlets, item categories, and city tiers. However, the organization lacks a centralized and interactive system to monitor sales performance, analyze customer preferences, and evaluate outlet-wise profitability. The objective of this project is to design an end-to-end Power BI dashboard that transforms raw sales data into meaningful insights by analyzing total sales, item performance, outlet size, outlet location, fat content, and customer ratings to support data-driven business decisions.

🎛Slicers
Outlet Location Type (Tier 1, 2, 3)
Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High)
Item Type (Snacks, Dairy, Drinks, etc.)
